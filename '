TODO
-----------------------
[DONE] start Distance Creations for 2m18 (split double duplex)
    + minimize 2m18 separately and run dist creations for both
    + rerun dynamics_and_move.py, ensuring that .dyn files are ported from
      previous dist.    

[CURRENT] run pulling sims for 2m18 


[CURRENT] run WHAM on 1my9    
    - need to replace prm file with current one:

        old param: RNA_CG_05_10_16_b_1p4eps.prm
        new param: RNA_CG_05_10_16_b_1p4eps_2p0tors.prm

        grep -rl 'RNA_CG_05_10_16_b_1p4eps.prm' . | xargs sed -i 's/RNA_CG_05_10_16_b_1p4eps.prm/RNA_CG_05_10_16_b_1p4eps_2p0tors.prm/g'

    | running for 1my9TOP_22..29p5




SIMULATION PROCEDURE
-----------------------
- run pdbxyz.x to create .xyz structure 
- run mapping_atocg.py to create cg.xyz structure
- run xyz2cg_xyz.py to create cg.xyz.xyz structure
- run minimize.py on cg.xyz.xyz structure

- change distance ranges in DistCreation.sh to [length of chain(s)] * 5.9
   DistCreation.sh accordingly
- run dynamics_and_move.py for all distances
- move *.arc files to separate directory
- run batch_runDynamics.py on all distances (in separate nodes)


WHAM PROCEDURE
-----------------------
- run setup_wham_sara.py on nodes where ran pulling simulations
- copy all *wham_input files to another node in a folder wham (use
    copy_files shell script)
- modify metadata.wham with file path of wham folder
- cut the number of windows based on the the systems
- run wham python script (takes about 30 minutes)
