TODO
-----------------------
start Distance Creations for 2m18 (split double duplex)
    + minimize 2m18 separately and run dist creations for both
    | rerun dynamics_and_move.py, ensuring that .dyn files are ported from
      previous dist.    
           - error: unable to find parameter file?


run pulling sims for 2m18


run WHAM on 1my9    
    | subprocess call analyze.x in setup_wham.py returning termination error due to:
        MECHANIC  --  Some Required Potential Energy Parameters are Undefined
        TINKER is Unable to Continue; Terminating the Current Calculation 




SIMULATION PROCEDURE
-----------------------
- run pdbxyz.x to create .xyz structure 
- run mapping_atocg.py to create cg.xyz structure
- run xyz2cg_xyz.py to create cg.xyz.xyz structure
- run minimize.py on cg.xyz.xyz structure

- change distance ranges in DistCreation.sh to (length of chain) * 5.9
- determine restrain & pulling positions using PyMOL, change
  dynamics_and_move.py accordingly
- run dynamics_and_move.py for all distances
- move *.arc files to separate directory
- run batch_runDynamics.py on all distances (in separate nodes)
